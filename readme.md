### 01 - Two Sum Algorithm 
The "Two Sum" problem is a classic algorithmic challenge where you're given an array of integers and a target sum. The goal is to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target and return their indices. Each input has exactly one solution, and you can't use the same element twice.
